# To whom it may concern
This is a DLL I am working on for use with GameMaker Studio. When (if) it is finished, it should allow a game developer to register a URI scheme for his game. However, it does not work yet.

## Current problem
Right now I'm trying (and failing) to figure out how to get the command line arguments of the game, and use them to re-launch the game with admin permissions.

I've got the admin permissions part, but getting the cli arguments is proving more difficult than I expected.

Any help is greatly appreciated.
